So far Finished with Assingment 1 and working on Assignment 2. Finally got it to git. Cannot use CodeName1 with VS Code since git on Eclipse is very weird
I will not be doing that.

Hopefully every time i submit a Assingment i will uplaod a new Commit to this Repo so it will be up to date for the Assingment
